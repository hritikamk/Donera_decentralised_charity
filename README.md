## Detailed Explanation of the Idea-

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
*The lack of transparency has made people lose trust in charities, making social funding stagnant. The donor is unaware of the legitimate utilization of his funds. Corruption adds to the distrust of the donor. This paper project a system called Donera that is a decentralized network built on the Ethereum blockchain. It helps social organizations to run projects transparently, using smart contract-based incentives to ensure their impact is independently verified and accessible to everyone. This makes it much easier for funders (philanthropic organizations, impact investors, small donors) to monitor their transactions and hence restore their trust in giving to such social organizations.*

## Why Blockchain can solve this problem?
As the basic technology of blockchain is decentralized, tamperproof, anonymous and traceable, that has great potential in transforming traditional industries. A blockchain is a distributed database system involving multiple independent nodes. The entire database is maintained by nodes throughout the network. The blockchain can record all transaction information, whose process is efficient and transparent and the data is highly secure. 

The charity organizations lack transparency and the supervision to them is difficult to achieve, which has a negative impact on the willingness of the people to donate. The Blockchain system provides a new solution for the charity system in terms of technology. This project proposes a charity system based on blockchain technology and expounds on the design pattern, architecture, and operational process of the platform. Some core functions of the charity platform have been realized and verified on Ethereum. We hope to increase the transparency of charities to enhance the public's trust in charities and promote the development of philanthropy by a blockchain-based charity system.

Blockchain technology can be used for protecting data security, defining access policies, ensuring the transparency of donations, and traceability of donation behaviors. As a transaction, cryptocurrency can thus ensure the security of transaction records, identity data, and relevant details. It is powered to monitor the process of capital flow and improve the functional network chain of relief materials. We also emphasize the comprehensive management and handling capability of material supply and establish a charity donation service system with sustained innovation in framework, technology, and operation. Blockchain has to receive more attention in the charity donation system in sharing donation data, managing information among donors and beneficiaries, in contract management among charitable organizations and enterprises

## Solution with features you are implementing-
The charity system model proposed is shown in the diagram. There are four roles: donors, beneficiaries, charity organizations, and cooperative stores. The charity organizations get the information to seeking help and create charity projects through the platform. Donors learn about charity projects on the platform, then donate to beneficiaries or the charity organizations. Beneficiaries upload their information to the platform for help, they can get and spend tokens in cooperative stores. The transactions that occurred in the stores will be uploaded to the charity platform. The cooperative stores supply services or goods to the beneficiaries to obtain tokens. The tokens can be exchanged for real money by charity organizations. The flow of funds has been fully recorded on the blockchain, which allows transactions to be tracked and funds prevented from being abused.

In this system, users complete the donation and use funds with smart contracts. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain to realize the traceability of funds, which increases the transparency of charities. The lack of transparency in charity activities could be solved technically with this blockchain charity system, which could increase the public’s trust in charity organizations.

### Donation type: organization, a direct beneficiary 
### Organization: 
### Any organization can register in CBC (Charity BlockChain) system.  They will upload documents, addresses, company info, etc.
### Once added users will be able to vote for the organization. Voting will be Fake/Genuine
### Once the voting reaches a target (e.g. min 500 user rating with >=90% Genuine), that organization will be marked as Genuine and will be open for receive donation.
### End users will be able to see all Genuine organizations and can donate any amount of money. Money will go directly to the organization’s account. 
### Direct beneficiary:
### The direct beneficiary will upload all details including the document and target goal of amount.
### End users will see all such requests and can donate money.
### Once the target is reached, the beneficiary can request a withdrawal. 
### A withdrawal request will open voting for the request.
### Any user can vote and once the voting reaches a target (e.g. 500 users with >=90%) the fund will be transferred to the beneficiary account, else money will be revert back to the donors.
